<p>
Spatial RNA localization is a key epigenetic mechanism regulating the spatiotemporal gene expression. This mechanism is particularly important in neurons and plays a crucial role in neuronal functions including neurite regeneration and synaptic plasticity which is the cellular basis underlying learning and memory and neurite circuit formation. Aberrant RNA localization has been observed in neurological disorders including Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD), and Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) neurodegenerative diseases. However, the regulatory mechanisms, functional roles, and pathological relevance of spatial RNA localization in neurons remain poorly understood, largely due to limited tools. The Han lab aims to address these knowledge caps by applying and developing cutting-edge synthetic biology, chemical biology, and CRISPR technologies to profile and manipulate the spatial transcriptome. Our long-term goal is to develop novel therapeutic strategies to treat neurological disorders including neurodegenerative diseases and substance use disorders via spatial transcriptome engineering.
